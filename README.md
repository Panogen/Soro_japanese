Hiragana and Katakana font modeled after my (current) handwriting.

Completed glyphs:
あいうえおかきくけこさしすせそたちつてとなにぬ

Font exports include two .ttf files, one for both Windows and Mac. Both .ttf's will be on the same version of the typeface.

HKSORO-100-00.birdfont is the main XML. Open in Birdfont to edit.

Installation

The .birdfont file itself cannot be installed. To install this version of the typeface, open whichever .ttf file corresponds to your operating system. Click the install button in the font viewer. If another version of the font is already installed, you will be prompted to overwrite it.

debug.log is automatically generated by Birdfont and may be ignored.
